Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ( 'COPPA' ) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under sixteen (16); if you are a child under sixteen (16), please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under sixteen (16), we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under sixteen (16) may have provided us personal information, please contact us at TOU@botlabs.gg.

What are the basics of using https://xfifier.github.io/impressive ?
You may need to access certain parts or features of the Services (e.g. our proprietary bots) by using your account credentials and password from other services ('Third Party Account'), such as those offered by Discord. By using the Services through a Third Party Account, you permit us to access certain information from such account for use by the Services. You are ultimately in control of how much information is accessible to us and may exercise such control by adjusting your privacy settings on your Third Party Account. We store your account credentials but will not store your password. You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not use any Third Party Account that you do not have the right to use, or another person's account credentials without authorization from that other person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.
You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you've received your parent's or guardian's permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If youâ€™re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization's or entity's behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to 'you' and 'your' in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).
Your access to and use of the bots made available on our website are subject to additional end user license agreement. You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party or any entity, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you arenâ€™t authorized to use the Services. We can't and won't be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.
You must protect the security of your Third Party Account credentials and password and any other access tools or credentials. You're responsible for any activity associated with your account.

Are there restrictions in how I can use the Services?
You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or User Submission (each of those terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:
infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including Bot Labs);
violates any law or regulation, including, without limitation, any applicable export control laws, privacy laws or any other purpose not reasonably intended by Bot Labs;
is dangerous, harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;
jeopardizes the security of your account or anyone elseâ€™s (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);
attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user;
violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;
runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or â€œspamâ€ on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Servicesâ€™ infrastructure);
crawls, scrapes or spiders any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);
copies or stores any significant portion of the Content; or
decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.
A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services</p>
